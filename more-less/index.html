      React.js makes it easier to build interactive web applications thanks to
      its reusable components, which simplifies the management of the user
      interface. Pure JavaScript, while powerful, can become complex for large
      applications, as it does not offer the same modular structure as React. In
      addition, React is more efficient in updating the user interface thanks to
      its "Virtual DOM", which minimizes manipulation of the real DOM. This
      makes applications more responsive and performant. Finally, the community
      around React offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that
      facilitate development.

        >If you're a software developer, data structures are your bread and
        butter. They're the fundamental building blocks of efficient algorithms
        and system design. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews,
        optimising your code, or working on complex applications, understanding
        how to use and implement data structures is essential. In this blog
        post, weâ€™ll break down 11 data structures that every developer should be
        familiar with. These structures are not only common in interviews but
        are also crucial for writing efficient and scalable code in real-world
        applications.</span
